## Encrypting entire messages

Instead of just encrypting and decrypting messages one character at a time, let's change the program to encrypt entire messages!



+ Firstly, check that your code looks like this:

+ Create a variable to store the new encrypted message.

+ Change your code to store the user's message and not just one character.

+ Add a `for` loop to your code, and indent the rest of the code so that it is repeated for each character in the message.

+ Test your code. You should see that each character in the message is encrypted and printed one at a time.

+ Let's add each encrypted character to your `newMessage` variable.

+ You can `print` the `newMessage` as it is being encrypted.

+ If you delete the spaces before the `print` statement, the encrypted message will only be displayed once at the end. You can also delete the code for printing the character positions.
